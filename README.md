# IoT-Based Industrial Monitoring System

## Overview
This project was developed during an internship at DRÄXLMAIER Group (Jun 2024 - Sep 2024) to build an IoT-based industrial monitoring system. The system uses ESP32 and ultrasonic sensors for real-time data acquisition, enabling predictive maintenance and productivity improvement.

## Features
- Real-time industrial data acquisition using ESP32 and ultrasonic sensors
- Wireless communication using MQTT
- Cloud visualization and data monitoring via ThingSpeak
- Mobile interface developed with MIT App Inventor
- Designed to improve predictive maintenance and industrial productivity

## Project Structure

## Technologies
- ESP32, Ultrasonic Sensors
- C++, IoT
- MQTT protocol
- ThingSpeak cloud platform
- MIT App Inventor for mobile interface

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 development board
- Ultrasonic distance sensors (HC-SR04 or similar)
- Wi-Fi network

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for ESP32 firmware
- MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto)
- ThingSpeak account for cloud visualization
- MIT App Inventor for mobile app

## Usage
1. Connect ESP32 to ultrasonic sensors.
2. Configure Wi-Fi and MQTT parameters in the firmware.
3. Flash firmware to ESP32.
4. Access real-time data on ThingSpeak dashboard.
5. Use the mobile app to monitor data on-the-go.
